          <p class="bio-text">
            Hello, my name is Cathy Pedersen. I'm a Full Stack Developer, who is
            a recent graduate of the Thinkful software engineering bootcamp, and
            an experienced test engineer with Python automation development
            experience.
          </p>
          <p class="bio-text">
            As a Quality Assurance engineer, I became adept at debugging failed
            test runs to see whether they had failed because of a bug in the
            automation code, a change in the features being implemented by
            Development, a bug in the product, or a lab problem. Coding
            automation was always my favorite part of Quality Assurance, so I
            decided to redirect my career toward software development. In this
            way, I could fully realize my potential as a developer. For me it's
            an opportunity to apply what I already know about the development
            and testing of user-friendly interfaces to my own projects. I'm keen
            to test my own code and to be careful about destabilizing the
            builds, while I clearly communicate to stakeholders any critical
            changes. Now everyday brings the excitement of new puzzles to solve
            as I progress on this development journey.
